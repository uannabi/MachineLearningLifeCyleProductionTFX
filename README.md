# MachineLearningLifeCyleProductionTFX

Welcome to the Machine Learning Production Lifecycle using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) repository! This project is focused on demonstrating the comprehensive lifecycle of a machine learning project, from data collection to advanced preprocessing techniques, using TFX.

## About This Project

This repository is designed to guide you through the various stages of a machine learning project lifecycle, utilizing TFX's robust and scalable framework. TFX is an end-to-end platform that facilitates the deployment of production-ready ML pipelines.

## Key Stages and Features

- **Collecting, Labeling, and Validating Data:** Learn the essentials of gathering and preparing your dataset, including techniques for data labeling and validation.
- **Feature Engineering, Transformation, and Selection:** Explore how to transform raw data into informative features and select the most relevant ones for your model.
- **Data Journey and Data Storage:** Understand the flow of data through the ML pipeline and best practices for data storage and management.
- **Advanced Data Labeling Methods:** Delve into more sophisticated methods for data labeling.
- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing Different Data Types:** Implement data augmentation strategies and preprocess various types of data to enhance model performance.
